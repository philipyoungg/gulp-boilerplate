      <h1>Employed VS Self Employed: My Decision After Graduation</h1>
      <p>2015 is one of my productive and life changing year ever. I learned a ton, achieved a ton, and sadly—lost tons of time here. This is also the same year I graduated from college and entered adult life. At last, I can focus on what matters now.</p>
      <p>This monumental event also gives me a mid life crisis. I will graduate soon. So, what will be the decision after graduation? Employed or self employed? My ego told me that working for others is a no-go. I should start my own business. Employment—metaphorically is a bird in golden cage. Living paycheck by paycheck is something that I never dreamed of.</p>
      <p>Okay, so entrepreneurship is the only choice. The next question is, what business I want to build? I’ve been struggling on this question for months, and no answer came to my mind. Thankfully, a friend of mine said: “Don’t you want to build your own agency”?</p>
